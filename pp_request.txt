**Subject:** Request to Issue UK Passport as per Current Name on Indian Passport  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to formally request the issuance of my UK passport in the name as it appears on my current Indian passport, without any surname addition. After reviewing the guidelines on Indian citizenship laws, I understand that India does not permit dual citizenship. Therefore, any further request to update my Indian passport is not allowed and is considered invalid.  

As I have already been granted UK citizenship, I am required to obtain a UK passport and subsequently surrender my Indian passport. Given this requirement, I kindly request that my UK passport be issued as per my current Indian passport details and that my previous request to add a surname be disregarded.  

I acknowledge that I will need to follow a specific sequence of steps to update my name formally:  
1. Obtain my UK passport  
2. Surrender my Indian passport  
3. Complete a deed poll to update my name  
4. Reapply for a UK passport with the updated name  

I appreciate your assistance in processing my passport application accordingly. Please let me know if you require any additional information.  

Yours sincerely,  
[Your Name]
