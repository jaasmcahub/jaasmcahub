Dear HM Passport Office,

I am writing to clarify the name details for my UK passport application. My naturalization certificate lists only my given name i.e. SHAINAZ, without a separate surname. I would like to retain my given name as both my given name and surname in my UK passport.

This is to ensure consistency across my official records and to avoid any discrepancies in future documentation. Kindly process my application with my given name appearing in both the "Given Name" and "Surname" fields.
Given Name : Shainaz
Surname : Shainaz

Please let me know if any further information or supporting documents are required.

Best regards,
Shainaz
